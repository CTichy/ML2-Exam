Question,Option,IsCorrect,Explanation
Which of the following are assumptions of multiple linear regression?,Linearity between predictors and response,True,Linearity is a fundamental assumption of linear regression.
Which of the following are assumptions of multiple linear regression?,Homoscedasticity of residuals,True,Residuals should have constant variance across fitted values.
Which of the following are assumptions of multiple linear regression?,Multicollinearity among predictors,False,"Multicollinearity is a problem, not an assumption."
Which of the following are assumptions of multiple linear regression?,Normal distribution of predictors,False,"Normality is assumed for residuals, not for predictors."
Which statistical tools are used to evaluate multiple regression models?,F-statistic,True,It tests whether the overall regression model is a good fit.
Which statistical tools are used to evaluate multiple regression models?,p-values,True,They assess the significance of individual predictors.
Which statistical tools are used to evaluate multiple regression models?,R-squared,True,It shows how much variance is explained by the model.
Which statistical tools are used to evaluate multiple regression models?,Precision,False,"Precision is a metric for classification problems, not regression."
Which of the following can indicate overfitting in a regression model?,High R-squared on training data,True,An unusually high R² on training data may suggest overfitting.
Which of the following can indicate overfitting in a regression model?,Poor performance on test data,True,Overfitted models often fail to generalize.
Which of the following can indicate overfitting in a regression model?,Low variance in predictors,False,Low variance doesn't imply overfitting; it may reduce predictive power.
Which of the following can indicate overfitting in a regression model?,Using adjusted R-squared,False,"Adjusted R² is a control against overfitting, not a symptom of it."
What are potential problems when including many predictors in a regression model?,Overfitting the model,True,Too many predictors can cause the model to fit noise.
What are potential problems when including many predictors in a regression model?,Increased risk of multicollinearity,True,More predictors raise the likelihood of correlation among them.
What are potential problems when including many predictors in a regression model?,Improved interpretability,False,Interpretability usually decreases with more variables.
What are potential problems when including many predictors in a regression model?,Lower residual variance by default,False,Adding variables doesn't guarantee lower residual variance.
Which conditions indicate that a predictor is statistically significant?,p-value below 0.05,True,A low p-value typically indicates statistical significance.
Which conditions indicate that a predictor is statistically significant?,Confidence interval for coefficient excludes zero,True,"If zero is not in the CI, the effect is likely real."
Which conditions indicate that a predictor is statistically significant?,F-statistic less than 1,False,"A low F-statistic suggests insignificance, not significance."
Which conditions indicate that a predictor is statistically significant?,High standard error of coefficient,False,A high standard error indicates imprecise estimation.
